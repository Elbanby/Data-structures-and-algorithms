# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

## Introduction
This repo will hold the implementation of different data structures in C.

You will be able to visualize Stacks, queue, trees and hash tables in C.

## background
Every week, I try implementing a data structure in C in a way that it would be easy to visualize for someone who is newly starting with C.


> Its a class that I am currently doing, so use this repo with cautious. Please submit an issues to improve the implementation.
It would be helpful not only for myself, but also for my colleges.
